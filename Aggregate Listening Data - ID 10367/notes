question:
You're tasked with analyzing a Spotify-like dataset that captures user listening habits.

For each user, calculate the total listening time and the count of unique songs they've listened to. In the database duration values are displayed in seconds. Round the total listening duration to the nearest whole minute.

The output should contain three columns: 'user_id', 'total_listen_duration', and 'unique_song_count'.


brainstorm:
Determine columns be in the result
Calculate total listen duration in minutes for each user
Find unique number of songs each user listen
Rename columns




solution:
select user_id, round(sum(ifnull(listen_duration, 0)) / 60.0) as total_listen_duration, count(distinct song_id) as unique_song_count from listening_habits group by user_id;
