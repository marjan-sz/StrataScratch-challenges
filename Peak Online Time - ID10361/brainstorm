question:
You are given a dataset from Amazon that tracks and aggregates user activity on their platform in certain time periods. For each device type, find the time period with the highest number of active users.
The output should contain 'user_count', 'time_period', and 'device_type', where 'time_period' is a concatenation of 'start_timestamp' and 'end_timestamp', like ; "start_timestamp to end_timestamp".


brainstorm:
1. group by dataset based on device_type column
2. for each group (device type), find the row (record) with highest user_count (hint: make sure to consider duplicate highest user_count for each device_type)
3. create a new column which concatenate start and end timestamps of above record (e.g. start_timestamp to end_timestamp)
4. remove extra columns
5. final dtaframe will have a record for each device_type with user_count and concatenated time-stamps

my solution:

# Import your libraries
import pandas as pd

# A function to return row indexes with highest user_count
def get_max_score(group):
    return group.loc[group['user_count'].max().merge(group)]



user_activity.head()
user_activity.shape
gd = user_activity.groupby('device_type', as_index=False).user_count.max().merge(user_activity)
gd['time_period'] = gd.apply(lambda row: str(row.start_timestamp) + " to " + str(row.end_timestamp), axis = 1)
final_df = gd.drop(['start_timestamp','end_timestamp','time_difference'], axis=1)
final_df.iloc[:,[1,2,0]]
